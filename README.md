# QuantumControl
** A work in progress repository for quantum control using Reinforcement Learning**
Quantum Control for high fidelity and fast quantum gates plays a crucial role in scalable quantum computing as it is an interface between the hardware stack and the cloud/compiler stack. The project is an attempt to make a universal (hardware independent) software solution for quantum control using Reinforcement learning.
